# Stock and Crypto Dashboard
## work in progress
A project that collects stock and cryptocurrency data and visualizes it using a dashboard built with Superset. The project includes data collection, processing, storage in a PostgreSQL database, and analysis with Python and SQL, as well as the scheduling and automation of these tasks with Airflow. The final result is a deployed dashboard on a website that updates with the latest data.
